#MicroContent for Social MicroLearning

##Concept and Idea

MicroContent is a type of digital learning material that is
* small (size, time to consume)
* interactive (requires the user to do something and gives feedback)

Clearly many types of content fullfil these criteria
and it is impossible to implement and include each potentially desired content type into a single system.

Therefore, for our Social MicroLearning system we use the concept of external or third-party content types.
A content type provider has to provide two things:
* a content viewer that is able to display data appropriatly
* an editor that is able to edit the data or create a new instance

##Examples

You can find examples in the github organization [MicroContent](https://github.com/MicroContent)
